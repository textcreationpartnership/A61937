            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Therefore the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets for which you humble your ſelf are in a deep pit, ſtrongly locked up, ſo that no man can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them unleſs he have received the Key from the Spirit of Truth. Of the Magical <expan>

                     </gap>or do they know what Nature is here: therefore teach they nothing, but remain Fools and Aſſes. Seeing that they now have divided <hi>Antimony</hi> from his Mineral <hi>Faeces,</hi> they ſhould alſo
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34860:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> know that in this <hi>Antimony</hi> there is as yet a <hi>Faeces,</hi> which is nothing elſe than a burning 🜍; when this 🜍 is divided, ſo cometh <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> again into his firſt matter or being, which is nothing elſe but fire; and this fire is nothing elſe but <hi>Arg. vive,</hi> and this <hi>Arg. vive</hi> is created out of the greateſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Nature; but <hi>Plato</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth me to reſt here. <hi>Vide Nicholas</hi> the <hi>Allobrogian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To divide the 🜍 from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Antimony</hi> is the clear Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but therein is a great knowledge hidden: So much thereof as is neceſſary for the knowledge of this Work will I manifeſt; but the other for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reaſons will I paſs by.</p>
                  <p>A thing if it be deſtroyed and mortified ſhall be raiſed again, and made living; and the ſame thing which is the cauſe of death
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34860:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> by ſeparating the life, muſt have two powers in it, of ſeparating and vivifying; and theſe two muſt be one in power, but two in numbers; for all Myſteries do ſpring from this Fountain, and are one Eſſence, wonderfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed according to the Will of God; this Will of God is the ſpecifick of every Creature, and a being incomprehenſible by ſenſe not leſs than God. Now is <hi>Arg. vive</hi> dead in <expan>

                        <ex>antimony</ex>
                     </expan>. Shall it be made living, ſo muſt it be raiſed up by that which it hath been ere it was dead; for that Life is in it very abundant, and incorruptible; there is nothing which is dead can be made living but by his own and proper life, and not by the life of other things; who writeth and teacheth otherwiſe is no Philoſopher; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed life when it is again made
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34860:41"/> living, is the Ferment of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things by which it was made living; and that thing is his Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Multiplication Magical. Hence it followeth that in living things there muſt be a diſpoſition which is tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table into the diſpoſition of other things, if it would be raiſed again; for the will of God that all things muſt die, is that Specifick of all Creatures which after death aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented it ſelf infinitely.</p>
                  <p>Now it followeth farther that thoſe living things which are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to our work and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al operation, by which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are alſo tranſmuted into <hi>Sol,</hi> muſt alſo have ſuch a Specifick, in that they can be brought thus by no art without Regeneration, as the ſenſeleſs Alchymiſts give forth; for were there no Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick therein, how could they be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34860:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> tranſmuted, becauſe Species is not tranſmuted into Species; for if tranſmutation be not done, ſo can alſo no ſeed grow and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf; for that is againſt Nature; therefore muſt that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving have the nature of water, as you ſee that a grain of Corn caſt into the Earth is made living by water; that is, in the Grain is a dead water, which is by water made living again, and the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water is that which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the water his ſpecifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo do infinite grains grow from one: So underſtand in this Operation that the <hi>Arg. vive</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> ♄ ♃ is dead, and can never more be made living but by <hi>Arg. vive.</hi> In this manner is Corruption regenerated, and Multiplication of the Form of Metals made.</p>
                  <p>You may here demand, Seeing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34860:42"/> the water multiplieth the grains in the earth, and is tranſmuted into very grains, if alſo the <hi>Arg. vive</hi> of Metals multiplied with common ☿, may be made again into a Metal? To this I anſwer, that this is not poſſible in common Metals, but in Philoſophical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals it may be done very eaſily; for our <hi>Mercury</hi> layeth his Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick from him, and taketh it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by Art; that is, from him may be made <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> which it was before; but why this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done in common Metals there are many Reaſons, which I will paſs by at this time.

Now that I may keep my promiſe, you ſhall know that this <hi>Regulus</hi> hath deceived the beſt Philoſophers and Chymiſts of greateſt account and reading amongſt us; for it is ſuch a rare Mineral that there is ſcarce the like in the world, and can make even the moſt Learned and underſtanding men Fools. What is given me from it, what I have ſeen from my good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions mark. In my little Book

So much belongeth to this point, I did not then much cumber or trouble my ſelf with it, but only explained my ſelf, and manifeſted the Medicines which are in it, and go under its name; but now know that out of this Regulus all Metals may be made, as Lead, Tin, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Iron, Silver and <hi>Sol,</hi> and ſo made, that to the appearance and in hammering, melting, caſting proof of the Teſt, and in the driving by <hi>Antimony,</hi> they are as good as the natural Metals. Lead which is made thereof is in all proofs good Lead, only it is a little harder than the Natural; but the Lead which is made of <hi>Antimony</hi> crude, not waſhed, hath
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34860:55"/> not that hardneſs; the Tin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fine, and before coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the Touchſtone ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as the fineſt <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> the Nature of Tin eaſily taketh it to its ſelf, and is eaſily made Tin.</p>
